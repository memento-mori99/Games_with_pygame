# Games_with_pygame

# I will have to thank Sentdex Youtube for teaching me to create the basics of this game and let me share the source code. Thank You Sentdex !!!

## Note that I am still developing this game, if you do want to learn python in a fun way I, do recommend making games with pygame either by readin books or from [HERE Sentdex Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujOTNg17LjI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdLkP8MrOXLe_rKuf6r80KO&index=1).

## If you have any ideas, please suggest to me.
